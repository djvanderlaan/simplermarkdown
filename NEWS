Changes in version 0.0.6

New features

  - New function `output_shell` that can be used to include and run non-R code
    blocks such as bash and python using `system2`. Code and output can be
    included in the resulting document.

  - Added `eval` argument to `output_eval` (the default output filter). When 
    FALSE the code in the block is not run.

  - For `output_eval` additional arguments in the markdown header of the code 
    block (between the `{}`) are passed on to the output block.

  - Warnings and messages can now also be captured in the output. Messages are
    captures by default. For warnings the option `capture_warnings` has to
    be set to `TRUE`.

Bug fixes

  - When run from a non-interactive session the code is no longer reformatted.

  - Empty code blocks are now by default omitted in the output.

  - The `raw_attribute` pandoc extension present in more recent versions of
    pandoc interfered with the procesessing of raw markdown blocks. This
    extension is now disabled.




Changes in version 0.0.4

New features

  - `md_figure` and `output_figure` can now echo the commands used to generate the
    figure. Use the arguments `echo` and `results` for that. 

  - Errors with hopefully more informative error messages in case something goes 
    wrong with the calls to pandoc.

Bug fixes

  - Markdown documents without a header block would generate an error. Fixed.

  - Output was truncated for longer blocks of code. Fixed.

  - Expressions such as `iris[, foo := Sepal.Width/Sepal.Length]` were
    'translated' to `iris[, `:=`(foo, Sepal.Width/Sepal.Length)]` in the output.
    Fixed.

  - When pandoc is not installed an empty dummy vignette is generated. This
    prevents warnings on the CRAN machines without pandoc. This should already
    have been working in the previous version except for a bug.
