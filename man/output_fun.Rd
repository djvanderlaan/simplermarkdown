\usage{
output_table(code, language = "R", id = "", ...)

output_figure(code, language = "R", id = "", ...)

output_eval(
  code,
  language = "R",
  id = "",
  echo = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{code}{character vector containing the code of the code block}

\item{language}{the language in which the code is written (as specified in
the markdown file).}

\item{id}{the identifier of the code block.}

\item{...}{additional arguments specified as arguments in the code block are
passed on to the filter function. Often these are ignored, or they are
passed on to other functions (see 'Details').}

\item{echo}{the code in \code{code} is repeated in the output.}

\item{results}{include the results of running the code in the output. The
output of code that explicitly writes to standard output is always
included.}

\item{drop_empty}{do not include any output if the resulting code block
would be empty.}
}
\value{
The functions either return a character vector with markdown,
or return a list with the correct structure to include in the pandow parse
tree.

\description{
Output filters for code blocks in markdown
}
\details{
The filter functions \code{tab} and \code{fig} call
\code{\link{md_table}} and \code{\link{md_figure}} respectively; additional
arguments are passed on to those functions. Other filter functions ignore the
additional arguments.

It is also possible to write custom output filter. An output filter should have
\code{code}, \code{language} and \code{id} as its first three arguments. It
should either return a character vector containing the markdown that should be
included in the resulting markdown file or an object that can be directly
included in the pandoc parse tree. If the function does not return a character
vector it is assumed the latter is returned. \code{simplermarkdown} defines a
small number of valid object constructors: \code{\link{raw_block}} and
\code{\link{markdown_block}}.

The custom function should be available when running the markdown document
through pandoc. The easiest way is to \code{\link{source}} or define the
function in the markdown document before using it.
